"""
A GPU-accelerated social simulation system designed for large-scale projection,
creating a living, breathing digital ecosystem that we can observe and interact 
with at theatrical scale.

Think of this project as creating a miniature society in your computer.
Just as people have personalities, locations, and relationships,
our digital beings will too!

## 2. Implementation Structure

### 2.1 Core Systems
```python
class Entity:
    def __init__(self, position, personality_seed):
        # Imagine each entity as a tiny person in our digital world.
        # They need a place to exist (position) and a unique character (personality)
        
        # Just like GPS coordinates tell us where we are on Earth,
        # these numbers tell our entity where it is in its world
        self.position = cp.array(position)  # Using the GPU for speed, like a super-calculator
        
        # Like a person standing still or walking,
        # velocity tells us how our entity is moving
        self.velocity = cp.zeros(2)  # Starts at rest, like a person standing still
        
        # Think of traits like a person's personality:
        # - Are they outgoing or shy? (sociability)
        # - Are they energetic or calm? (energy)
        # - Are they a leader or follower? (influence)
        self.traits = {
            'sociability': np.random.normal(0.5, 0.2),  # Most people are somewhere in the middle
            'energy': np.random.normal(0.5, 0.2),       # Using bell curve - like real human traits
            'influence': np.random.normal(0.5, 0.2)     # Some lead, some follow, most in between
        }
        
        # Like how we see people with our eyes,
        # these properties determine how our entity looks
        self.color = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.8])  # Green with slight transparency
        self.size = 5.0                               # How big they appear
        self.connections = []                         # Their friendships, like a social network
```

## 3. Core Simulation Systems

"""
Our digital universe is like a simplified version of our own:
Simple rules lead to complex behaviors, just like in nature!
"""

### 3.1 Entity Physics Engine
```python
class EntityPhysics:
    """The laws of motion for our digital beings"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Think of these as giant spreadsheets:
        # Each row is an entity, columns are their properties
        self.position_buffer = cp.zeros((MAX_ENTITIES, 2))
        self.velocity_buffer = cp.zeros((MAX_ENTITIES, 2))
        self.acceleration_buffer = cp.zeros((MAX_ENTITIES, 2))

    @cuda.jit
    def update_physics(self, dt):
        """
        This is like watching a busy street for a split second:
        - Cars (entities) move along the road (change position)
        - They speed up or slow down (change velocity)
        - Everything happens at once!
        """
        tid = cuda.grid(1)
        if tid < self.position_buffer.shape[0]:
            # Update position (like seeing where a car ends up after a moment)
            self.position_buffer[tid] += self.velocity_buffer[tid] * dt
            # Update velocity (like watching the speedometer change)
            self.velocity_buffer[tid] += self.acceleration_buffer[tid] * dt
```

### 3.2 Social Interaction Engine
```python
class SocialDynamics:
    """
    This is like watching how people mingle at a party:
    - They notice who's nearby
    - They form connections
    - They influence each other's moods and behaviors
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Imagine dividing a room into small areas to quickly find who's where
        self.spatial_grid = SpatialHash(WORLD_SIZE, CELL_SIZE)
        # This is like a giant friendship chart
        self.relationships = cp.zeros((MAX_ENTITIES, MAX_ENTITIES))

    def compute_interactions(self):
        """Calculating how entities affect each other"""
        for cell in self.spatial_grid:
            # Find all entities in this small area (like one corner of a party)
            entities = self.get_entities_in_cell(cell)
            # See how they interact (like watching conversations and body language)
            self.process_local_interactions(entities)
```

### 3.3 Emotional State System
```python
class EmotionalState:
    """
    Just as people have changing moods,
    our digital beings have feelings too!
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Imagine each number as a mood meter for each entity
        self.happiness = cp.random.uniform(0, 1, MAX_ENTITIES)
        self.energy = cp.random.uniform(0, 1, MAX_ENTITIES)
        self.sociability = cp.random.uniform(0, 1, MAX_ENTITIES)

    def update_emotions(self, social_context):
        """Emotions change based on what's happening around them"""
        # We'll adjust these 'mood meters' based on:
        # - Who's nearby (like being with friends or strangers)
        # - Recent events (like having a good conversation)
        # - What they're doing (like working or relaxing)
```

### 3.4 Group Behavior System
```python
class GroupDynamics:
    """
    This is like watching crowds form and change:
    Our digital beings can create patterns just like real crowds!
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.groups = []  # Active groups (like different social circles)
        self.coherence_threshold = 0.7  # How 'tight-knit' a group needs to be

    def identify_groups(self):
        """Finding natural groupings of entities"""
        # Get everyone's current position (like taking a snapshot of a crowd)
        positions = self.physics.position_buffer.get()
        # Use smart math (DBSCAN clustering) to find groups
        # It's like looking from above and circling groups of people
        groups = self.cluster_entities(positions)
```

### 3.5 Performance Optimization
```python
"""
Just like a busy city needs good infrastructure,
our digital world needs efficient systems to run smoothly
"""

@cuda.jit
def batch_update_kernel(positions, velocities, neighbors, dt):
    """
    This is like having a super-fast army of helpers:
    Each one updates a single entity, but they all work at the same time!
    """
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    if idx < positions.shape[0]:
        # Update one entity (like one helper focusing on one person)
        update_single_entity(positions, velocities, neighbors, idx, dt)

class MemoryManager:
    """
    Think of this as organizing a giant library of information:
    We want to find any book (piece of data) quickly!
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # Like having a well-organized set of shelves for our entities
        self.entity_pool = EntityPool(MAX_ENTITIES)
        # And special fast-access cabinets for frequent information
        self.gpu_buffers = GPUBufferManager()
```

## 4. Usage Example
```python
# Create our digital universe (like setting up a new aquarium)
world = SocialWorld(
    physics_engine=EntityPhysics(),
    social_engine=SocialDynamics(),
    emotional_engine=EmotionalState(),
    group_engine=GroupDynamics()
)

# Start the simulation (like letting time flow in our digital aquarium)
while True:
    # Update positions (like watching fish swim)
    world.physics_engine.update(dt)
    # Calculate social interactions (like seeing fish form schools)
    world.social_engine.compute_interactions()
    # Update emotions (like watching fish react to their environment)
    world.emotional_engine.update_emotions(world.get_social_context())
    # Identify groups (like noticing patterns in fish behavior)
    world.group_engine.identify_groups()
    # Show the current state (like taking a picture of the aquarium)
    world.render()
```

## 5. Display Integration
```python
class ProjectorDisplay:
    """
    This is our window into the digital universe.
    Like a special telescope that shows us our tiny digital world!
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # Setting up our 'telescope' specs
        self.resolution = (1920, 1080)  # How detailed our view is
        self.refresh_rate = 60  # How often we update the image (60 times per second)
        self.vsync = True  # This prevents the image from looking 'torn'
```

## 6. Development Workflow

### 6.1 Environment Setup
```bash
# Setting up our digital laboratory
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Checking our equipment
python tests/verify_cuda.py
python tests/verify_display.py  # Make sure our 'telescope' is working
```

### 6.2 Display Configuration
```python
def verify_display_chain():
    """
    Like checking all the lenses in our telescope,
    we make sure each part of our display system is working
    """
    check_gpu_output()  # Is our 'eye' (GPU) working?
    verify_hdmi_connection()  # Is the 'optic nerve' (HDMI) connected?
    test_refresh_rate()  # How fast can we 'blink' (update the image)?
```

## 7. Performance Specifications

## 8. Interaction Systems

### 8.1 Controller Integration
```python
class SimulationController:
    """
    This gives us godlike powers over our digital world.
    The PS4 controller becomes a magic wand to shape reality!
    """
    def __init__(self):
        # Set up our 'magic wand' (PS4 controller)
        self.ps4 = self._initialize_controller()
        # And our 'all-seeing eye' (camera to view the world)
        self.camera = ProjectionCamera()
```

### 8.2 Visual Feedback
```python
class EmotiveDisplay:
    """
    This system shows the inner feelings of our digital beings.
    It's like having special glasses that let us see emotions!
    """
    def render_emotional_state(self, entity):
        # Turn internal feelings into colors and movements
        # Like watching mood rings change, but for our whole digital world
        pass
